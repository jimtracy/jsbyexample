By now you have mastered number, boolaean, and string literals, expressions, statements, assignment, while loops, function definitions, and function calls. 
Now its time for arrays.

An array is a kind of list. You can create one with square brackets. Here's an example:
```javascript
my_array = [1,2,3,4,5];
```

Now you can refer to the individual elements in the array using their position (again, with square brackets). This is called "dereferencing" the array. Try this:
```
my_array = [1,2,3,4,5];
print(my_array[3]);
print(my_array[0]);
```
Notice that the first position in the array is numbered 0, and not 1.
